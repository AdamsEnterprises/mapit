<p>MaPit is our previously internal-only database that maps postcodes and
points to administrative areas and more. It has been rewritten from the ground
up in GeoDjango and a PostGIS database, providing us with a large array of
improvements including speed and ease of maintenance (our old manual boundary
loading scripts dated from 2003 and were somewhat arcane). The source code is
<a href="http://github.com/mysociety/mapit">available on GitHub</a>.

<p>Another notable benefit is this new version has been filled with only
totally open data, so you can be secure that you can reuse the data from this
site under the minimal terms of the licences given below. It is based on OS
OpenData Boundary-Line and Code-Point for Great Britain, and NSPD Open for
Northern Ireland.

<p id="copyright">This database contains Ordnance Survey data © Crown copyright and database right 2010.
It contains Royal Mail data © Royal Mail copyright and database right 2010.
It contains National Statistics data © Crown copyright and database right 2010.
Great Britain data may be used under the terms of the <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/oswebsite/opendata/licence/">OS OpenData licence</a> (PDF).
Northern Ireland data may be used under the terms of the <a href="http://www.ons.gov.uk/about-statistics/geography/products/geog-products-postcode/nspd/nspd-open-licence.doc">NSPD Open licence</a> (Word).

<h2>API calls</h2>

<p>By default, calls with return active areas; for some calls you may specify
a previous generation to look up instead. As of writing, we are on generation
13 for the May 2010 edition of OS Boundary-Line. The main difference in
generation 12 is that it contains the pre-2010 England and Wales Parliamentary
constituencies (it doesn't hold pre-2010 Northern Ireland constituencies, but
they were coterminious with the Northern Ireland Assembly constituencies, so
you can just use them instead).</p>

<h3>By postcode</h3>

<ul>

<li>/postcode/<i>[postcode]</i> &ndash; information on a particular postcode,
including its location in both National Grid and WGS84 latitude/longitude, and
the areas it is contained within. You may specify a previous generation as a
?generation=N parameter.

<li>/postcode/partial/<i>[partial postcode]</i> &ndash; location information on the
centroid of a partial postcode.

</ul>

<h3>By area ID</h3>

<p>Whenever an area is returned from MaPit, it is as a dictionary
with the following keys: id, name, country, type, parent_area,
generation_low, generation_high, codes.

<ul>

<li>/area/<i>[area ID]</i> &amp; /area/ons/<i>[ONS code]</i> &ndash; information on a particular area. 

<li>/area/<i>[area ID]</i>/example_postcode &ndash; a random postcode within the area specified.

<li>/area/<i>[area ID]</i>/children &ndash; all the children of a particular area (e.g. all
the <a href="http://mapit.mysociety.org/area/2236/children">electoral divisions of a county council</a>).

<li>/area/<i>[area ID]</i>/geometry &ndash; geometry information on the area including its centroid, extent and area.

<li>/area/<i>[area ID]</i>.<i>[kml|json|wkt]</i> &ndash; the actual geometry of the area, in the specified format.

</ul>

<h3>By point</h3>

<p>A SRID is a unique number referring to a particular co-ordinate system; the
two you probably are interested in are 27700 for British National Grid and 4326
for WGS84 lon/lat (oh, and 29902 for the Irish National Grid). You can restrict
results to particular area types with a type parameter (multiple types
separated by commas), and have results for a previous generation with a
generation parameter.</p>

<ul>

<li>/point/<i>[SRID]</i>/<i>[x]</i>,<i>[y]</i> &ndash; the areas covering the particular point.

<li>/point/<i>[SRID]</i>/<i>[x]</i>,<i>[y]</i>/bb &ndash; the areas whose bounding boxes cover the
particular point. In case the previous call is too slow.

</ul>

<h3>Multiple areas</h3>

<ul>

<li>/areas/<i>[area IDs, separated by commas]</i> &mdash; information on more than one
area at once, as a dictionary indexed by area ID.

<li>/areas/<i>[area IDs, separated by commas]/geometry &ndash; all the geometry
information you would get from single geometry calls.

<li>/areas/<i>[type OR types]</i> &ndash; all the areas in a specific area type, such
as WMC or DIS, or types (separated by commas). You may specific a minimum
generation with the min_generation parameter (this is for FixMyStreet, which
needs to show expired councils on its All Reports page).

<li>/areas/<i>[name]</i> &ndash; all areas that start with the specified text. You
may restrict results to a type or types with the type parameter (as always,
multiple separated by commas), or expand to previous generations with the
min_generation parameter.

</ul>
