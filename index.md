MapIt
=====

MapIt is a service that maps geographical points to administrative areas. It is
useful for anyone who has the co-ordinates of a point on Earth, and who needs
to find out what country, region, city, constituency, or state it lies within.
Itâ€™s also great for looking up the shapes of all those boundaries.

[mySociety][] (the UK charity that wrote this code) runs several public MapIts
that you can use:

* [MapIt Global] - global boundaries from the [OSM] project.
* [MapIt UK] - UK boundaries from various sources.

The above are free for non-commercial, low-volume use.

Technical Overview
------------------

The `mapit` directory contains a standard [GeoDjango] app, and the `project`
directory contains an example GeoDjango project using that app. Other top-level
things are mostly to fit within mySociety's standard deployment, or country
specific data, one-off scripts and so on.

MapIt has been installed on Debian lenny and squeeze, and on Ubuntu from 10.04
onwards. If GeoDjango and [PostGIS] run on it, it should theoretically be okay;
do let us know of any problems.

Installation
------------

MapIt can be installed as a Django app, or as a standalone server. Full details
are in `INSTALL.rst`.

Country specific READMEs
------------------------

These are extensive notes for some of the countries that MapIt has been set up
to serve. These are in the `docs` folder:

* UK: `docs/README-UK.rst`
* Norway: `docs/README-NORWAY.rst`
