Importing data
==============

MapIt has two main sorts of data -- boundary polygon data (to show the
boundaries of councils or other types of administrative areas), and postcode
point data (if your country has a system of mapping strings to points in some
way, such as the UK postcode or the US zip code).

If you have some KML or Shapefiles of some boundaries, you can load these into
MapIt directly using an import script -- see [Importing
boundaries](boundaries/) for more details.

Importing postal code data is also straightforward -- see TODO.
