{"google":"","body":"MapIt\r\n=====\r\n\r\nMapIt is a service that maps geographical points to administrative areas. It is\r\nuseful for anyone who has the co-ordinates of a point on Earth, and who needs\r\nto find out what country, region, city, constituency, or state it lies within.\r\nItâ€™s also great for looking up the shapes of all those boundaries.\r\n\r\n[mySociety](http://www.mysociety.org) (the UK charity that wrote this code)\r\nruns several public MapIts that you can use:\r\n\r\n* [MapIt Global](http://global.mapit.mysociety.org/) - global boundaries from the [OSM](http://www.openstreetmap.org/) project.\r\n* [MapIt UK](http://mapit.mysociety.org/) - UK boundaries from various sources.\r\n\r\nThe above are free for non-commercial, low-volume use.\r\n\r\nTechnical Overview\r\n------------------\r\n\r\nThe `mapit` directory contains a standard [GeoDjango](http://geodjango.org/) app, and the `project` directory contains an example GeoDjango project using that app. Other top-level things are mostly to fit within mySociety's standard deployment, or country specific data, one-off scripts and so on.\r\n\r\nMapIt has been installed on Debian lenny and squeeze, and on Ubuntu from 10.04 onwards. If GeoDjango and [PostGIS](http://postgis.refractions.net/) run on it, it should theoretically be okay; do let us know of any problems.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n------------\r\n\r\nMapIt can be installed as a Django app, or as a standalone server. Full details\r\nare in `INSTALL.rst`.\r\n\r\nCountry specific READMEs\r\n------------------------\r\n\r\nThese are extensive notes for some of the countries that MapIt has been set up\r\nto serve. These are in the `docs` folder:\r\n\r\n* UK: `docs/README-UK.rst`\r\n* Norway: `docs/README-NORWAY.rst`\r\n\r\nImprovements / patches\r\n----------------------\r\n\r\nAre welcome :)\r\n\r\nThe code is hosted on GitHub and we use their bug tracker too:\r\n\r\n* https://github.com/mysociety/mapit\r\n* https://github.com/mysociety/mapit/issues\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file!
